      <p>This is an app designed to help organize Persian Nowruz Eid Didanis!
      Those who participate are familiar with the long drives, showing up to a house only to find that your relatives are also out at their eid didanis, and the desperate need to find a restroom after drinking wayyyy too much tea at your auntie's house. </p>
